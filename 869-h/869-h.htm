      THE SOUL OF NICHOLAS SNYDERS,<br /> OR THE MISER OF ZANDAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time in Zandam, which is by the Zuider Zee, there lived a
      wicked man named Nicholas Snyders. He was mean and hard and cruel, and
      loved but one thing in the world, and that was gold. And even that not for
      its own sake. He loved the power gold gave him&mdash;the power to
      tyrannize and to oppress, the power to cause suffering at his will. They
      said he had no soul, but there they were wrong. All men own&mdash;or, to
      speak more correctly, are owned by&mdash;a soul; and the soul of Nicholas
      Snyders was an evil soul. He lived in the old windmill which still is
      standing on the quay, with only little Christina to wait upon him and keep
      house for him. Christina was an orphan whose parents had died in debt.
      Nicholas, to Christina&rsquo;s everlasting gratitude, had cleared their memory&mdash;it
      cost but a few hundred florins&mdash;in consideration that Christina
      should work for him without wages. Christina formed his entire household,
      and only one willing visitor ever darkened his door, the widow Toelast.
      Dame Toelast was rich and almost as great a miser as Nicholas himself.
      &ldquo;Why should not we two marry?&rdquo; Nicholas had once croaked to the widow
      Toelast. &ldquo;Together we should be masters of all Zandam.&rdquo; Dame Toelast had
      answered with a cackling laugh; but Nicholas was never in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Nicholas Snyders sat alone at his desk in the centre of the
      great semi-circular room that took up half the ground floor of the
      windmill, and that served him for an office, and there came a knocking at
      the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; cried Nicholas Snyders. He spoke in a tone quite kind for
      Nicholas Snyders. He felt so sure it was Jan knocking at the door&mdash;Jan
      Van der Voort, the young sailor, now master of his own ship, come to
      demand of him the hand of little Christina. In anticipation, Nicholas
      Snyders tasted the joy of dashing Jan&rsquo;s hopes to the ground; of hearing
      him plead, then rave; of watching the growing pallor that would overspread
      Jan&rsquo;s handsome face as Nicholas would, point by point, explain to him the
      consequences of defiance&mdash;how, firstly, Jan&rsquo;s old mother should be
      turned out of her home, his old father put into prison for debt; how,
      secondly, Jan himself should be pursued without remorse, his ship be
      bought over his head before he could complete the purchase. The interview
      would afford to Nicholas Snyders sport after his own soul. Since Jan&rsquo;s
      return the day before, he had been looking forward to it. Therefore,
      feeling sure it was Jan, he cried &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; quite cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not Jan. It was somebody Nicholas Snyders had never set eyes on
      before. And neither, after that one visit, did Nicholas Snyders ever set
      eyes upon him again. The light was fading, and Nicholas Snyders was not
      the man to light candles before they were needed, so that he was never
      able to describe with any precision the stranger&rsquo;s appearance. Nicholas
      thought he seemed an old man, but alert in all his movements; while his
      eyes&mdash;the one thing about him Nicholas saw with any clearness&mdash;were
      curiously bright and piercing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Nicholas Snyders, taking no pains to disguise his
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a pedlar,&rdquo; answered the stranger. His voice was clear and not
      unmusical, with just the suspicion of roguishness behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wanting anything,&rdquo; answered Nicholas Snyders drily. &ldquo;Shut the door
      and be careful of the step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But instead the stranger took a chair and drew it nearer, and, himself in
      shadow, looked straight into Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; face and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure, Nicholas Snyders? Are you quite sure there is nothing
      you require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; growled Nicholas Snyders&mdash;&ldquo;except the sight of your back.&rdquo;
       The stranger bent forward, and with his long, lean hand touched Nicholas
      Snyders playfully upon the knee. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like a soul, Nicholas
      Snyders?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it,&rdquo; continued the strange pedlar, before Nicholas could recover
      power of speech. &ldquo;For forty years you have drunk the joy of being mean and
      cruel. Are you not tired of the taste, Nicholas Snyders? Wouldn&rsquo;t you like
      a change? Think of it, Nicholas Snyders&mdash;the joy of being loved, of
      hearing yourself blessed, instead of cursed! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be good fun,
      Nicholas Snyders&mdash;just by way of a change? If you don&rsquo;t like it, you
      can return and be yourself again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Nicholas Snyders, recalling all things afterwards, could never
      understand was why he sat there, listening in patience to the stranger&rsquo;s
      talk; for, at the time, it seemed to him the jesting of a wandering fool.
      But something about the stranger had impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it with me,&rdquo; continued the odd pedlar; &ldquo;and as for price&mdash;&rdquo;
       The stranger made a gesture indicating dismissal of all sordid details. &ldquo;I
      look for my reward in watching the result of the experiment. I am
      something of a philosopher. I take an interest in these matters. See.&rdquo; The
      stranger dived between his legs and produced from his pack a silver flask
      of cunning workmanship and laid it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its flavour is not unpleasant,&rdquo; explained the stranger. &ldquo;A little bitter;
      but one does not drink it by the goblet: a wineglassful, such as one would
      of old Tokay, while the mind of both is fixed on the same thought: &lsquo;May my
      soul pass into him, may his pass into me!&rsquo; The operation is quite simple:
      the secret lies within the drug.&rdquo; The stranger patted the quaint flask as
      though it had been some little dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will say: &lsquo;Who will exchange souls with Nicholas Snyders?&rsquo;&rdquo; The
      stranger appeared to have come prepared with an answer to all questions.
      &ldquo;My friend, you are rich; you need not fear. It is the possession men
      value the least of all they have. Choose your soul and drive your bargain.
      I leave that to you with one word of counsel only: you will find the young
      readier than the old&mdash;the young, to whom the world promises all
      things for gold. Choose you a fine, fair, fresh, young soul, Nicholas
      Snyders; and choose it quickly. Your hair is somewhat grey, my friend.
      Taste, before you die, the joy of living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange pedlar laughed and, rising, closed his pack. Nicholas Snyders
      neither moved nor spoke, until with the soft clanging of the massive door
      his senses returned to him. Then, seizing the flask the stranger had left
      behind him, he sprang from his chair, meaning to fling it after him into
      the street. But the flashing of the firelight on its burnished surface
      stayed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, the case is of value,&rdquo; Nicholas chuckled, and put the flask
      aside and, lighting the two tall candles, buried himself again in his
      green-bound ledger. Yet still from time to time Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; eye
      would wander to where the silver flask remained half hidden among dusty
      papers. And later there came again a knocking at the door, and this time
      it really was young Jan who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan held out his great hand across the littered desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We parted in anger, Nicholas Snyders. It was my fault. You were in the
      right. I ask you to forgive me. I was poor. It was selfish of me to wish
      the little maid to share with me my poverty. But now I am no longer poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; responded Nicholas in kindly tone. &ldquo;I have heard of it. So now
      you are master and the owner of your ship&mdash;your very own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My very own after one more voyage,&rdquo; laughed Jan. &ldquo;I have Burgomaster
      Allart&rsquo;s promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A promise is not a performance,&rdquo; hinted Nicholas. &ldquo;Burgomaster Allart is
      not a rich man; a higher bid might tempt him. Another might step in
      between you and become the owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jan only laughed. &ldquo;Why, that would be the work of an enemy, which, God be
      praised, I do not think that I possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky lad!&rdquo; commented Nicholas; &ldquo;so few of us are without enemies. And
      your parents, Jan, will they live with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wished it,&rdquo; answered Jan, &ldquo;both Christina and I. But the mother is
      feeble. The old mill has grown into her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand,&rdquo; agreed Nicholas. &ldquo;The old vine torn from the old wall
      withers. And your father, Jan; people will gossip. The mill is paying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jan shook his head. &ldquo;It never will again; and the debts haunt him. But all
      that, as I tell him, is a thing of the past. His creditors have agreed to
      look to me and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them?&rdquo; queried Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them I could discover,&rdquo; laughed Jan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Snyders pushed back his chair and looked at Jan with a smile upon
      his wrinkled face. &ldquo;And so you and Christina have arranged it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your consent, sir,&rdquo; answered Jan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will wait for that?&rdquo; asked Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should like to have it, sir.&rdquo; Jan smiled, but the tone of his voice
      fell agreeably on Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; ear. Nicholas Snyders loved best
      beating the dog that, growled and showed its teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not wait for that,&rdquo; said Nicholas Snyders. &ldquo;You might have to wait
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jan rose, an angry flush upon his face. &ldquo;So nothing changes you, Nicholas
      Snyders. Have it your own way, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will marry her in spite of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of you and of your friends the fiends, and of your master the
      Devil!&rdquo; flung out Jan. For Jan had a soul that was generous and brave and
      tender and excessively short-tempered. Even the best of souls have their
      failings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said old Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; answered Jan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for your mother,&rdquo; explained Nicholas. &ldquo;The poor dame, I fear,
      will be homeless in her old age. The mortgage shall be foreclosed, Jan, on
      your wedding-day. I am sorry for your father, Jan. His creditors, Jan&mdash;you
      have overlooked just one. I am sorry for him, Jan. Prison has always been
      his dread. I am sorry even for you, my young friend. You will have to
      begin life over again. Burgomaster Allart is in the hollow of my hand. I
      have but to say the word, your ship is mine. I wish you joy of your bride,
      my young friend. You must love her very dearly&mdash;you will be paying a
      high price for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; grin that maddened Jan. He sought for something
      that, thrown straight at the wicked mouth, should silence it, and by
      chance his hand lighted on the pedlar&rsquo;s silver flask. In the same instance
      Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; hand had closed upon it also. The grin had died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; commanded Nicholas Snyders. &ldquo;Let us talk further.&rdquo; And there
      was that in his voice that compelled the younger man&rsquo;s obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonder, Jan, why I seek always anger and hatred. I wonder at times
      myself. Why do generous thoughts never come to me, as to other men!
      Listen, Jan; I am in a whimsical mood. Such things cannot be, but it is a
      whim of mine to think it might have been. Sell me your soul, Jan, sell me
      your soul, that I, too, may taste this love and gladness that I hear
      about. For a little while, Jan, only for a little while, and I will give
      you all you desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man seized his pen and wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Jan, the ship is yours beyond mishap; the mill goes free; your
      father may hold up his head again. And all I ask, Jan, is that you drink
      to me, willing the while that your soul may go from you and become the
      soul of old Nicholas Snyders&mdash;for a little while, Jan, only for a
      little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With feverish hands the old man had drawn the stopper from the pedlar&rsquo;s
      flagon, had poured the wine into twin glasses. Jan&rsquo;s inclination was to
      laugh, but the old man&rsquo;s eagerness was almost frenzy. Surely he was mad;
      but that would not make less binding the paper he had signed. A true man
      does not jest with his soul, but the face of Christina was shining down on
      Jan from out the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will mean it?&rdquo; whispered Nicholas Snyders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May my soul pass from me and enter into Nicholas Snyders!&rdquo; answered Jan,
      replacing his empty glass upon the table. And the two stood looking for a
      moment into one another&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the high candles on the littered desk flickered and went out, as
      though a breath had blown them, first one and then the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be getting home,&rdquo; came the voice of Jan from the darkness. &ldquo;Why
      did you blow out the candles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can light them again from the fire,&rdquo; answered Nicholas. He did not add
      that he had meant to ask that same question of Jan. He thrust them among
      the glowing logs, first one and then the other; and the shadows crept back
      into their corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not stop and see Christina?&rdquo; asked Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; answered Jan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paper that I signed,&rdquo; Nicholas reminded him&mdash;&ldquo;you have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten it,&rdquo; Jan answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man took it from the desk and handed it to him. Jan thrust it into
      his pocket and went out. Nicholas bolted the door behind him and returned
      to his desk; sat long there, his elbow resting on the open ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas pushed the ledger aside and laughed. &ldquo;What foolery! As if such
      things could be! The fellow must have bewitched me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas crossed to the fire and warmed his hands before the blaze.
      &ldquo;Still, I am glad he is going to marry the little lass. A good lad, a good
      lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas must have fallen asleep before the fire. When he opened his eyes,
      it was to meet the grey dawn. He felt cold, stiff, hungry, and decidedly
      cross. Why had not Christina woke him up and given him his supper. Did she
      think he had intended to pass the night on a wooden chair? The girl was an
      idiot. He would go upstairs and tell her through the door just what he
      thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His way upstairs led through the kitchen. To his astonishment, there sat
      Christina, asleep before the burnt-out grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; muttered Nicholas to himself, &ldquo;people in this house don&rsquo;t
      seem to know what beds are for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not Christina, so Nicholas told himself. Christina had the look
      of a frightened rabbit: it had always irritated him. This girl, even in
      her sleep, wore an impertinent expression&mdash;a delightfully impertinent
      expression. Besides, this girl was pretty&mdash;marvellously pretty.
      Indeed, so pretty a girl Nicholas had never seen in all his life before.
      Why had the girls, when Nicholas was young, been so entirely different! A
      sudden bitterness seized Nicholas: it was as though he had just learnt
      that long ago, without knowing it, he had been robbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child must be cold. Nicholas fetched his fur-lined cloak and wrapped
      it about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something else he ought to do. The idea came to him while
      drawing the cloak around her shoulders, very gently, not to disturb her&mdash;something
      he wanted to do, if only he could think what it was. The girl&rsquo;s lips were
      parted. She appeared to be speaking to him, asking him to do this thing&mdash;or
      telling him not to do it. Nicholas could not be sure which. Half a dozen
      times he turned away, and half a dozen times stole back to where she sat
      sleeping with that delightfully impertinent expression on her face, her
      lips parted. But what she wanted, or what it was he wanted, Nicholas could
      not think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Christina would know. Perhaps Christina would know who she was and
      how she got there. Nicholas climbed the stairs, swearing at them for
      creaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christina&rsquo;s door was open. No one was in the room; the bed had not been
      slept upon. Nicholas descended the creaking stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was still asleep. Could it be Christina herself? Nicholas
      examined the delicious features one by one. Never before, so far as he
      could recollect, had he seen the girl; yet around her neck&mdash;Nicholas
      had not noticed it before&mdash;lay Christina&rsquo;s locket, rising and falling
      as she breathed. Nicholas knew it well; the one thing belonging to her
      mother Christina had insisted on keeping. The one thing about which she
      had ever defied him. She would never have parted with that locket. It must
      be Christina herself. But what had happened to her? Or to himself.
      Remembrance rushed in upon him. The odd pedlar! The scene with Jan! But
      surely all that had been a dream? Yet there upon the littered desk still
      stood the pedlar&rsquo;s silver flask, together with the twin stained glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas tried to think, but his brain was in a whirl. A ray of sunshine
      streaming through the window fell across the dusty room. Nicholas had
      never seen the sun, that he could recollect. Involuntarily he stretched
      his hands towards it, felt a pang of grief when it vanished, leaving only
      the grey light. He drew the rusty bolts, flung open the great door. A
      strange world lay before him, a new world of lights and shadows, that
      wooed him with their beauty&mdash;a world of low, soft voices that called
      to him. There came to him again that bitter sense of having been robbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have been so happy all these years,&rdquo; murmured old Nicholas to
      himself. &ldquo;It is just the little town I could have loved&mdash;so quaint,
      so quiet, so homelike. I might have had friends, old cronies, children of
      my own maybe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vision of the sleeping Christina flashed before his eyes. She had come
      to him a child, feeling only gratitude towards him. Had he had eyes with
      which to see her, all things might have been different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it too late? He is not so old&mdash;not so very old. New life is in
      his veins. She still loves Jan, but that was the Jan of yesterday. In the
      future, Jan&rsquo;s every word and deed will be prompted by the evil soul that
      was once the soul of Nicholas Snyders&mdash;that Nicholas Snyders
      remembers well. Can any woman love that, let the case be as handsome as
      you will?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ought he, as an honest man, to keep the soul he had won from Jan by what
      might be called a trick? Yes, it had been a fair bargain, and Jan had
      taken his price. Besides, it was not as if Jan had fashioned his own soul;
      these things are chance. Why should one man be given gold, and another be
      given parched peas? He has as much right to Jan&rsquo;s soul as Jan ever had. He
      is wiser, he can do more good with it. It was Jan&rsquo;s soul that loved
      Christina; let Jan&rsquo;s soul win her if it can. And Jan&rsquo;s soul, listening to
      the argument, could not think of a word to offer in opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christina was still asleep when Nicholas re-entered the kitchen. He
      lighted the fire and cooked the breakfast and then aroused her gently.
      There was no doubt it was Christina. The moment her eyes rested on old
      Nicholas, there came back to her the frightened rabbit look that had
      always irritated him. It irritated him now, but the irritation was against
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were sleeping so soundly when I came in last night&mdash;&rdquo; Christina
      commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were afraid to wake me,&rdquo; Nicholas interrupted her. &ldquo;You thought
      the old curmudgeon would be cross. Listen, Christina. You paid off
      yesterday the last debt your father owed. It was to an old sailor&mdash;I
      had not been able to find him before. Not a cent more do you owe, and
      there remains to you, out of your wages, a hundred florins. It is yours
      whenever you like to ask me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christina could not understand, neither then nor during the days that
      followed; nor did Nicholas enlighten her. For the soul of Jan had entered
      into a very wise old man, who knew that the best way to live down the past
      is to live boldly the present. All that Christina could be sure of was
      that the old Nicholas Snyders had mysteriously vanished, that in his place
      remained a new Nicholas, who looked at her with kindly eyes&mdash;frank
      and honest, compelling confidence. Though Nicholas never said so, it came
      to Christina that she herself, her sweet example, her ennobling influence
      it was that had wrought this wondrous change. And to Christina the
      explanation seemed not impossible&mdash;seemed even pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of his littered desk was hateful to him. Starting early in the
      morning, Nicholas would disappear for the entire day, returning in the
      evening tired but cheerful, bringing with him flowers that Christina
      laughed at, telling him they were weeds. But what mattered names? To
      Nicholas they were beautiful. In Zandam the children ran from him, the
      dogs barked after him. So Nicholas, escaping through byways, would wander
      far into the country. Children in the villages around came to know a kind
      old fellow who loved to linger, his hands resting on his staff, watching
      their play, listening to their laughter; whose ample pockets were
      storehouses of good things. Their elders, passing by, would whisper to one
      another how like he was in features to wicked old Nick, the miser of
      Zandam, and would wonder where he came from. Nor was it only the faces of
      the children that taught his lips to smile. It troubled him at first to
      find the world so full of marvellously pretty girls&mdash;of pretty women
      also, all more or less lovable. It bewildered him. Until he found that,
      notwithstanding, Christina remained always in his thoughts the prettiest,
      the most lovable of them all. Then every pretty face rejoiced him: it
      reminded him of Christina.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return the second day, Christina had met him with sadness in her
      eyes. Farmer Beerstraater, an old friend of her father&rsquo;s, had called to
      see Nicholas; not finding Nicholas, had talked a little with Christina. A
      hardhearted creditor was turning him out of his farm. Christina pretended
      not to know that the creditor was Nicholas himself, but marvelled that
      such wicked men could be. Nicholas said nothing, but the next day Farmer
      Beerstraater had called again, all smiles, blessings, and great wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can have come to him?&rdquo; repeated Farmer Beerstraater over and
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christina had smiled and answered that perhaps the good God had touched
      his heart; but thought to herself that perhaps it had been the good
      influence of another. The tale flew. Christina found herself besieged on
      every hand, and, finding her intercessions invariably successful, grew day
      by day more pleased with herself, and by consequence more pleased with
      Nicholas Snyders. For Nicholas was a cunning old gentleman. Jan&rsquo;s soul in
      him took delight in undoing the evil the soul of Nicholas had wrought. But
      the brain of Nicholas Snyders that remained to him whispered: &ldquo;Let the
      little maid think it is all her doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news reached the ears of Dame Toelast. The same evening saw her seated
      in the inglenook opposite Nicholas Snyders, who smoked and seemed bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a fool of yourself, Nicholas Snyders,&rdquo; the Dame told him.
      &ldquo;Everybody is laughing at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather they laughed than cursed me,&rdquo; growled Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten all that has passed between us?&rdquo; demanded the Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I could,&rdquo; sighed Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your age&mdash;&rdquo; commenced the Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am feeling younger than I ever felt in all my life,&rdquo; Nicholas
      interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look it,&rdquo; commented the Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do looks matter?&rdquo; snapped Nicholas. &ldquo;It is the soul of a man that is
      the real man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They count for something, as the world goes,&rdquo; explained the Dame. &ldquo;Why,
      if I liked to follow your example and make a fool of myself, there are
      young men, fine young men, handsome young men&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me stand in your way,&rdquo; interposed Nicholas quickly. &ldquo;As you
      say, I am old and I have a devil of a temper. There must be many better
      men than I am, men more worthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say there are not,&rdquo; returned the Dame: &ldquo;but nobody more suitable.
      Girls for boys, and old women for old men. I haven&rsquo;t lost my wits,
      Nicholas Snyders, if you have. When you are yourself again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Snyders sprang to his feet. &ldquo;I am myself,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and intend
      to remain myself! Who dares say I am not myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; retorted the Dame with exasperating coolness. &ldquo;Nicholas Snyders is
      not himself when at the bidding of a pretty-faced doll he flings his money
      out of the window with both hands. He is a creature bewitched, and I am
      sorry for him. She&rsquo;ll fool you for the sake of her friends till you
      haven&rsquo;t a cent left, and then she&rsquo;ll laugh at you. When you are yourself,
      Nicholas Snyders, you will be crazy with yourself&mdash;remember that.&rdquo;
       And Dame Toelast marched out and slammed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls for boys, and old women for old men.&rdquo; The phrase kept ringing in
      his ears. Hitherto his new-found happiness had filled his life, leaving no
      room for thought. But the old Dame&rsquo;s words had sown the seed of
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Christina fooling him? The thought was impossible. Never once had she
      pleaded for herself, never once for Jan. The evil thought was the creature
      of Dame Toelast&rsquo;s evil mind. Christina loved him. Her face brightened at
      his coming. The fear of him had gone out of her; a pretty tyranny had
      replaced it. But was it the love that he sought? Jan&rsquo;s soul in old Nick&rsquo;s
      body was young and ardent. It desired Christina not as a daughter, but as
      a wife. Could it win her in spite of old Nick&rsquo;s body? The soul of Jan was
      an impatient soul. Better to know than to doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not light the candles; let us talk a little by the light of the fire
      only,&rdquo; said Nicholas. And Christina, smiling, drew her chair towards the
      blaze. But Nicholas sat in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You grow more beautiful every day, Christina,&rdquo; said Nicholas-&ldquo;sweeter and
      more womanly. He will be a happy man who calls you wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile passed from Christina&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I shall never marry,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;Never is a long word, little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true woman does not marry the man she does not love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But may she not marry the man she does?&rdquo; smiled Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes she may not,&rdquo; Christina explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christina&rsquo;s face was turned away. &ldquo;When he has ceased to love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soul in old Nick&rsquo;s body leapt with joy. &ldquo;He is not worthy of you,
      Christina. His new fortune has changed him. Is it not so? He thinks only
      of money. It is as though the soul of a miser had entered into him. He
      would marry even Dame Toelast for the sake of her gold-bags and her broad
      lands and her many mills, if only she would have him. Cannot you forget
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget him. I shall never love another man. I try to hide
      it; and often I am content to find there is so much in the world that I
      can do. But my heart is breaking.&rdquo; She rose and, kneeling beside him,
      clasped her hands around him. &ldquo;I am glad you have let me tell you,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;But for you I could not have borne it. You are so good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer he stroked with his withered hand the golden hair that fell
      disordered about his withered knees. She raised her eyes to him; they were
      filled with tears, but smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think sometimes that you and he must
      have changed souls. He is hard and mean and cruel, as you used to be.&rdquo; She
      laughed, and the arms around him tightened for a moment. &ldquo;And now you are
      kind and tender and great, as once he was. It is as if the good God had
      taken away my lover from me to give to me a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Christina,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is the soul that is the man, not
      the body. Could you not love me for my new soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do love you,&rdquo; answered Christina, smiling through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you as a husband?&rdquo; The firelight fell upon her face. Nicholas,
      holding it between his withered hands, looked into it long and hard; and
      reading what he read there, laid it back against his breast and soothed it
      with his withered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jesting, little one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Girls for boys, and old women for
      old men. And so, in spite of all, you still love Jan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him,&rdquo; answered Christina. &ldquo;I cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he would, you would marry him, let his soul be what it may?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him,&rdquo; answered Christina. &ldquo;I cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Nicholas sat alone before the dying fire. Is it the soul or the body
      that is the real man? The answer was not so simple as he had thought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christina loved Jan&rdquo;&mdash;so Nicholas mumbled to the dying fire&mdash;&ldquo;when
      he had the soul of Jan. She loves him still, though he has the soul of
      Nicholas Snyders. When I asked her if she could love me, it was terror I
      read in her eyes, though Jan&rsquo;s soul is now in me; she divined it. It must
      be the body that is the real Jan, the real Nicholas. If the soul of
      Christina entered into the body of Dame Toelast, should I turn from
      Christina, from her golden hair, her fathomless eyes, her asking lips, to
      desire the shrivelled carcass of Dame Toelast? No; I should still shudder
      at the thought of her. Yet when I had the soul of Nicholas Snyders, I did
      not loathe her, while Christina was naught to me. It must be with the soul
      that we love, else Jan would still love Christina and I should be Miser
      Nick. Yet here am I loving Christina, using Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; brain and
      gold to thwart Nicholas Snyders&rsquo; every scheme, doing everything that I
      know will make him mad when he comes back into his own body; while Jan
      cares no longer for Christina, would marry Dame Toelast for her broad
      lands, her many mills. Clearly it is the soul that is the real man. Then
      ought I not to be glad, thinking I am going back into my own body, knowing
      that I shall wed Christina? But I am not glad; I am very miserable. I
      shall not go with Jan&rsquo;s soul, I feel it; my own soul will come back to me.
      I shall be again the hard, cruel, mean old man I was before, only now I
      shall be poor and helpless. The folks will laugh at me, and I shall curse
      them, powerless to do them evil. Even Dame Toelast will not want me when
      she learns all. And yet I must do this thing. So long as Jan&rsquo;s soul is in
      me, I love Christina better than myself. I must do this for her sake. I
      love her&mdash;I cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Nicholas rose, took from the place, where a month before he had hidden
      it, the silver flask of cunning workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just two more glassfuls left,&rdquo; mused Nicholas, as he gently shook the
      flask against his ear. He laid it on the desk before him, then opened once
      again the old green ledger, for there still remained work to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke Christina early. &ldquo;Take these letters, Christina,&rdquo; he commanded.
      &ldquo;When you have delivered them all, but not before, go to Jan; tell him I
      am waiting here to see him on a matter of business.&rdquo; He kissed her and
      seemed loth to let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall only be a little while,&rdquo; smiled Christina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All partings take but a little while,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nicholas had foreseen the trouble he would have. Jan was content, had
      no desire to be again a sentimental young fool, eager to saddle himself
      with a penniless wife. Jan had other dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, man, drink!&rdquo; cried Nicholas impatiently, &ldquo;before I am tempted to
      change my mind. Christina, provided you marry her, is the richest bride in
      Zandam. There is the deed; read it; and read quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Jan consented, and the two men drank. And there passed a breath
      between them as before; and Jan with his hands covered his eyes a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity, perhaps, that he did so, for in that moment Nicholas
      snatched at the deed that lay beside Jan on the desk. The next instant it
      was blazing in the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so poor as you thought!&rdquo; came the croaking voice of Nicholas. &ldquo;Not so
      poor as you thought! I can build again, I can build again!&rdquo; And the
      creature, laughing hideously, danced with its withered arms spread out
      before the blaze, lest Jan should seek to rescue Christina&rsquo;s burning dowry
      before it was destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan did not tell Christina. In spite of all Jan could say, she would go
      back. Nicholas Snyders drove her from the door with curses. She could not
      understand. The only thing clear was that Jan had come back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a strange madness that seized upon me,&rdquo; Jan explained. &ldquo;Let the
      good sea breezes bring us health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So from the deck of Jan&rsquo;s ship they watched old Zandam till it vanished
      into air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christina cried a little at the thought of never seeing it again; but Jan
      comforted her and later new faces hid the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      And old Nicholas married Dame Toelast, but, happily, lived to do evil only
      for a few years longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after, Jan told Christina the whole story, but it sounded very
      improbable, and Christina&mdash;though, of course, she did not say so&mdash;did
      not quite believe it, but thought Jan was trying to explain away that
      strange month of his life during which he had wooed Dame Toelast. Yet it
      certainly was strange that Nicholas, for the same short month, had been so
      different from his usual self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought Christina, &ldquo;if I had not told him I loved Jan, he would
      not have gone back to his old ways. Poor old gentleman! No doubt it was
      despair.&rdquo;
     </p>

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
